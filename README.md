# dada2-rs

📖 **Documentation:** [dada2-rs.readthedocs.io](https://dada2-rs.readthedocs.io) — installation, Illumina/PacBio walkthroughs, and the performance/benchmarking reference.

An experimental implementation of DADA2 in Rust, using Claude Code (specically Sonnet 4.6 and Opus 4.6/4.7/4.8) for the bulk of the work. 

## Implementations

Rust ports of:

  | Step | DADA2 (R) | dada2-rs |
  |---|---|---|
  | Filter/trimming FASTQ | `filterAndTrim` | `filter-and-trim` |
  | Filter/trimming FASTQ (PacBio) | `removePrimers`,`filterAndTrim` | `remove-primers` (one step) |
  | Dereplication | `derepFastq` | `derep` |
  | Error models | `learnErrors` | `learn-errors` |
  | Denoising | `dada` | `dada` |
  | Merging | `mergePairs` | `merge-pairs` |
  | Chimera removal | `removeBimeraDenovo` | `remove-bimera-denovo` |
  | RDP taxonomic classifier | `assignTaxonomy` + `assignSpecies` | `assign-taxonomy` + `assign-species` |
  | Merging sequence tables | `mergeSequenceTables` | `make-sequence-table` (accepts multiple inputs) |
  | Making sequence tables from multiple inputs | `makeSequenceTable` | `make-sequence-table` |

- Current error models:
  - `loessErrfun`
  - `PacBioErrfun`
  - `noqualErrfun`
  - `makeBinnedErrfun`
  - Custom error models in R and/or Python - *Experimental, tested*
- Other functionality:
  - Helper functions to convert sequence tables to TSV or FASTA (`seq-table-to-fasta`, `seq-table-to-tsv`)
  - Helper function to convert taxonomic output to TSV (`tax-to-tsv`)
  - Basic scripts and examples for comparing results between runs to trace
    differences
  - Experimental sub-sampling function for input FASTQ (`sample`) and related error model function (`errors-from-sample`) that mirrors `learn-errors` (can be used for bootstrapping)
  - Intermediate outputs (in JSON) - can be evaluated for debugging purposes or for plotting in R, Python, etc.
  - Dedicated Docker builds available
- In progress
  - Summary FASTQ metrics and plots

## Building & installing

Requires a recent stable Rust toolchain ([rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)).

```bash
cargo build --release
# binary at target/release/dada2-rs
```

Common tasks are wrapped by a `justfile` (canonical) and an equivalent
portable `Makefile` — use whichever you have; targets/recipes match:

```bash
just build            # or: make build      → release binary
just check            # or: make check      → fmt-check + clippy + tests

# install the binary + helper R/Python scripts onto PATH; scripts are
# namespaced as dada2-rs-<name> (e.g. dada2-rs-plot-errors). Use the
# env-var form for overrides — it works for both just and make:
PREFIX=/usr/local make install
```

For the native (`-C target-cpu=native`) build and Docker, see
**[Installation](docs/installation.md)**.

## Subcommands

| Subcommand | Description |
|---|---|
| `filter-and-trim` | Filter and trim FASTQ reads (mirrors `filterAndTrim`) |
| `derep` | Dereplicate a FASTQ file |
| `sample` | Dereplicate and subsample FASTQ files, one JSON per sample |
| `errors-from-sample` | Learn error model from derep JSON files |
| `learn-errors` | Learn error model directly from FASTQ files |
| `dada` | Denoise a sample using a learned error model |
| `merge-pairs` | Merge denoised forward and reverse reads |
| `make-sequence-table` | Build a sample × sequence count table |
| `remove-bimera-denovo` | Remove chimeric sequences |
| `summary` | Per-position quality metrics from a FASTQ |

Run `dada2-rs <subcommand> --help` for full parameter documentation.

## Usage & walkthroughs

End-to-end examples live in the documentation:

- **[Illumina MiSeq walkthrough](docs/walkthrough-illumina.md)** (paired-end)
- **[PacBio HiFi walkthrough](docs/walkthrough-pacbio.md)** (single-end, primer removal + PacBio-tuned params)

Run `dada2-rs <subcommand> --help` for the full parameter set of any step.

## Benchmarks & comparison with R DADA2

Performance is benchmarked head-to-head against R DADA2 with the harness in
`dev/benchmark/`. See the docs for the tooling, metrics, and results:

- **[Performance — tooling & metrics](docs/benchmarking.md)** (the harness,
  `cores`/`cpu_s`/peak-RSS, scaling sweeps, built-in logs, concordance checks)
- **[Benchmark results](docs/results.md)** (head-to-head scorecards by platform
  and pooling mode)

## AI Assistance Disclosure

See **[the project overview](docs/about.md)** for the project's origins and goals, which are directly relevant here.

This tool was written with the assistance of AI coding agents, specifically Claude Code, using Sonnet and Opus LLMs. All commits using AI assistance are openly noted.

Correctness is validated by comparing output against DADA2 v1.36 on a suite of real sequencing datasets - not by manual code review alone. 
AI generated the implementation; humans defined the validation criteria, made some key coding updates, and verified results.
