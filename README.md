# dada2-rs

📖 **Documentation:** [dada2-rs.readthedocs.io](https://dada2-rs.readthedocs.io) — installation, Illumina/PacBio walkthroughs, and the performance/benchmarking reference.

An experimental implementation of DADA2 in Rust, using Claude Code (specically Sonnet 4.6 and Opus 4.6/4.7/4.8) for the bulk of the work. 

## Implementations

Rust ports of:

  | Step | DADA2 (R) | dada2-rs |
  |---|---|---|
  | Filter/trimming FASTQ | `filterAndTrim` | `filter-and-trim` |
  | Filter/trimming FASTQ (PacBio) | `removePrimers`,`filterAndTrim` | `remove-primers` (one step) |
  | Dereplication | `derepFastq` | `derep` |
  | Error models | `learnErrors` | `learn-errors` |
  | Denoising | `dada` | `dada` |
  | Merging | `mergePairs` | `merge-pairs` |
  | Chimera removal | `removeBimeraDenovo` | `remove-bimera-denovo` |
  | RDP taxonomic classifier | `assignTaxonomy` + `assignSpecies` | `assign-taxonomy` + `assign-species` |
  | Merging sequence tables | `mergeSequenceTables` | `make-sequence-table` (accepts multiple inputs) |
  | Making sequence tables from multiple inputs | `makeSequenceTable` | `make-sequence-table` |

- Current error models:
  - `loessErrfun`
  - `PacBioErrfun`
  - `noqualErrfun`
  - `makeBinnedErrfun`
  - Custom error models in R and/or Python - *Experimental, tested*
- Other functionality:
  - Helper functions to convert sequence tables to TSV or FASTA (`seq-table-to-fasta`, `seq-table-to-tsv`)
  - Helper function to convert taxonomic output to TSV (`tax-to-tsv`)
  - Basic scripts and examples for comparing results between runs to trace
    differences
  - Experimental sub-sampling function for input FASTQ (`sample`) and related error model function (`errors-from-sample`) that mirrors `learn-errors` (can be used for bootstrapping)
  - Intermediate outputs (in JSON) - can be evaluated for debugging purposes or for plotting in R, Python, etc.
  - Dedicated Docker builds available
- In progress
  - Summary FASTQ metrics and plots

## Building

Requires a recent stable Rust toolchain ([rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)).

```bash
cargo build --release
# binary at target/release/dada2-rs
```

For the native (`-C target-cpu=native`) build and Docker, see
**[Installation](docs/installation.md)**.

## Subcommands

| Subcommand | Description |
|---|---|
| `filter-and-trim` | Filter and trim FASTQ reads (mirrors `filterAndTrim`) |
| `derep` | Dereplicate a FASTQ file |
| `sample` | Dereplicate and subsample FASTQ files, one JSON per sample |
| `errors-from-sample` | Learn error model from derep JSON files |
| `learn-errors` | Learn error model directly from FASTQ files |
| `dada` | Denoise a sample using a learned error model |
| `merge-pairs` | Merge denoised forward and reverse reads |
| `make-sequence-table` | Build a sample × sequence count table |
| `remove-bimera-denovo` | Remove chimeric sequences |
| `summary` | Per-position quality metrics from a FASTQ |

Run `dada2-rs <subcommand> --help` for full parameter documentation.

## Usage & walkthroughs

End-to-end examples live in the documentation:

- **[Illumina MiSeq walkthrough](docs/walkthrough-illumina.md)** (paired-end)
- **[PacBio HiFi walkthrough](docs/walkthrough-pacbio.md)** (single-end, primer removal + PacBio-tuned params)

Run `dada2-rs <subcommand> --help` for the full parameter set of any step.

## Benchmarks & comparison with R DADA2

Performance is benchmarked head-to-head against R DADA2 with the harness in
`comparison/benchmark/`. See the docs for the tooling, metrics, and results:

- **[Performance — tooling & metrics](docs/benchmarking.md)** (the harness,
  `cores`/`cpu_s`/peak-RSS, scaling sweeps, built-in logs, concordance checks)
- **[Benchmark results](docs/results.md)** (head-to-head scorecards by platform
  and pooling mode)


## AI Assistance Disclosure

This tool was written with the assistance of AI coding agents, specificall Claude Code, using Sonnet 4.6. All commits using AI are noted.

Correctness is validated by comparing output against DADA2 v1.36 on a suite of real sequencing datasets - not by manual code review alone. 
AI generated the implementation; humans defined the validation criteria, made some key coding updates, and verified results.

## Project background

The original purpose of the project was exploratory: walk through the steps in the DADA2 workflow to understand the underlying implementation for each key command, initially to replicate results from the R DADA2 workflow but to also explore potential paths for improving the implementation, as we use this quite extensively in our own research. 

This is now at an interesting stage, as the current implementation up to the 'learn errors' error model step, closely matches results from DADA2 but runs about 5x faster with 8x less memory. 

### Learning

This was also meant to be a learning opportunity on several fronts. I have been learning Rust over the last few years in my (vanishingly small) spare time, and actually planned a general port of DADA2 a few years back. I had programmed various languages over the years (Perl, Python, R, C++, and a little Java), but apart from R and Python I'm pretty, um, rusty, 

### AI

I have noticed a dramatic improvement in coding-based AI tools and agents, also noted by many others in the field. However there has been a lot of discussion on the best approaches to reimplementation strategies involving these approaches, and many controversies along the way. 

I've long been involved in open-source development and open-science projects, and I'm also the leader of a bioinformatics core group. I understand the community responses to this as well as the potential benefits to this community, and I believe community standards are needed that ensure we follow some general guidelines that ensure some degree of consistency and support, provenance that ensure the original implementors retain clear credit for their work, and where community members can play an active role.

### Guidelines

AI is having a clear, fundamental, and disruptive impact, and simply ignoring this is to one's detriment. Some of us are also mentors, and as such we have an obligation to understand this wildly changing landscape and help prepare students, postdocs, and scientist on how to best use AI for their future career path. However many controveries exist over the use of these tools, in some cases arguably crossing moral and ethical boundaries. Standards are sorely needed.

Thankfully, within the bioinformatics community these are starting to coalesce, for example [rewrites.bio](https://rewrites.bio). Therefore, this project will follow [rewrites.bio](https://rewrites.bio) guidelines as closely as possible to: 

* Ensure the original DADA2 developers and contributors are acknowledged,
* Follows the original implementation's details,
* Include tests and benchmarks for the work,
* Utilize consistent libraries where possible,
* Release as open source and follow the original licensing
* Should interest arise: develop a community that can contribute.

#### Caveat

One point where this implementation will vary from the rewrites.bio standards: due to some key implementation details (conversion of R/C++ to Rust including error models), results will vary slightly. However we will strive to reproduce results as closely as possible. We have added the ability to use R and Python for custom error model analysis to more closely emulate what we see from the original implementation.

We also do not want to prevent additional outcomes or functionality that may come from the work in this project by being constrained to emulating the original code. For example, one interesting side benefit for PacBio HiFi reads has come from exposing the k-mer size as an option: alternative k-mer lengths appear to improve performance for PacBio denoising; this is something that needs to be explored more but could result in a substantial improvement in processing.
