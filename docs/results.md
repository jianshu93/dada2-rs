# Benchmark results

Head-to-head performance vs R DADA2 on representative datasets. Numbers come from
the benchmark harness (see [Tooling & metrics](benchmarking.md)) run on our
cluster — the datasets are large, so these are run manually and the tables below
are regenerated from each run's `summary.csv` with
[`bench_table.py`](#regenerating-these-tables).

## Methodology

- **Function-vs-function.** Each mode compares the dada2-rs subcommand against
  its direct R analog, one process each: `dada-pooled` ↔ `pool=TRUE`, multi-input
  `dada` ↔ `pool=FALSE`, `dada-pseudo` ↔ `pool="pseudo"`.
- **Wall** is the fair end-to-end time (R as a single process). **Speedup** =
  R wall ÷ dada2-rs wall.
- **Peak RSS** is the per-process high-water mark; the ratio is R ÷ dada2-rs
  (>1× means dada2-rs uses less memory, <1× means more).
- **Build:** `release-native` unless noted. See
  [build target](benchmarking.md#6-build-target-matters).
- **Correctness** (ASV concordance) is validated separately — see
  [concordance tooling](benchmarking.md#5-concordance-validation-tooling).

!!! note "Populate from a cluster run"
    We generate the results using `comparison/benchmark/bench_pooled.py` 
    and summarize with:
    ```bash
    python3 comparison/benchmark/bench_table.py \
        "pooled=bench_true/summary.csv" \
        "per-sample=bench_false/summary.csv" \
        "pseudo=bench_pseudo/summary.csv"
    ```
    then paste the table below.

## PacBio HiFi

Data is from Hergenrother 2024, 93 total samples, PacBio Sequel IIe.

PacBio is benchmarked from `--kmer-size 5` (matched to R's fixed
`KMER_SIZE = 5` — isolates kernel + threading speed) to `--kmer-size 7`
(dada2-rs recommended default for PacBio — adds the k-mer screen-effectiveness gain). See the [PacBio notes](benchmarking.md#7-pacbio-vs-illumina-specifics).

`*` - values from k=5 run

Note that R DADA2 currently has a fixed (hard-coded) k-mer size of 5 for screening. This seems to have the effect of reducing k-mer screening efficiency almost to a no-op, with almost every unique sequence proceeding to NW alignment.

Our current implementation currently uses more memory (last column), an issue we are chasing down. Two of the pooling modes have a low memory setting which we are also benchmarking which should alleviate this with some performance tradeoff.

### Preliminary observation and results

**Recommendation:** use `--kmer-size 7` for PacBio runs, especially if your compute has a decent memory footprint. 

- Increasing the k-mer length marginally has a significant effect, reducing walltime dramatically. 
- Preliminary followup (to be added) indicates this has essentially **no impact** on the ASVs derived post-chimera removal as well as their counts (to be added below), and may actually increase sensitivity slightly, with a few more ASVs recovered in the `dada2-rs` runs
- Pre-chimera results differ slightly from R DADA2 (with some ASVs found unique to both runs). However as noted above these are essentially removed with chimera removal, suggesting their lower abundance
- `dada2-rs` utilizes more memory than expected for these steps, which we are in the process of evaluating

We are also evaluating the general effect that increasing k-mer size has on clustering with the different pooling results, including basic exploratory testing using higher k-mers. Initial k=8 results confirms this increases memory usage dramatically (>100GB), so we don't anticipate this will have practical use.

### Per step comparisons

**PacBio pooled, k=7** — dada2-rs vs R (R-single end-to-end wall)

| Step | dada2-rs wall (s) | dada2-rs cores | dada2-rs peak (MB) | R wall (s) | Speedup |

**PacBio pseudo, k=7** — dada2-rs vs R (R-single end-to-end wall)

**PacBio, no pooling, k=7** — dada2-rs vs R (R-single end-to-end wall)

| Step | dada2-rs wall (s) | dada2-rs cores | dada2-rs peak (MB) | R wall (s) | Speedup |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| remove_primers | 27.6 | 20.4 | 29 | 5373.3 | **195.0×** |

| TOTAL | 283.7 | 21.4 | 8873 | 8129.6 | **28.7×** |

Note that most of the walltime improvement is actually dominated by the `remove-primers` step (which combines two steps from DADA2: `removePrimers` and filterAndTrim). However significant improvements are also apparent for both the `learn-errors` and `dada` steps for each pooling mode.

`*` - values from k=5 run

Moderate k-mer difference in pooled runs only, but an overall improvement in performance (2.5-5.9x). We only recommend k=5 for most runs, maybe k=6 for pooled runs.

## Regenerating these tables

After a run, distill its `summary.csv` to Markdown:

```bash
# scorecard across modes (one row per run)
python3 comparison/benchmark/bench_table.py \
    "pooled=bench_true/summary.csv" \
    "per-sample=bench_false/summary.csv" \
    "pseudo=bench_pseudo/summary.csv"

# per-step breakdown for one run
python3 comparison/benchmark/bench_table.py --per-step bench_pseudo/summary.csv
```

Paste the output into the tables above.
