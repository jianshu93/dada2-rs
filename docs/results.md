# Benchmark results

Head-to-head performance vs R DADA2 on representative datasets. Numbers come from
the benchmark harness (see [Tooling & metrics](benchmarking.md)) run on our
cluster — the datasets are large, so these are run manually and the tables below
are regenerated from each run's `summary.csv` with
[`bench_table.py`](#regenerating-these-tables).

## Methodology

- **Function-vs-function.** Each mode compares the dada2-rs subcommand against
  its direct R analog, one process each: `dada-pooled` ↔ `pool=TRUE`, multi-input
  `dada` ↔ `pool=FALSE`, `dada-pseudo` ↔ `pool="pseudo"`.
- **Wall** is the fair end-to-end time (R as a single process). **Speedup** =
  R wall ÷ dada2-rs wall.
- **Peak RSS** is the per-process high-water mark; the ratio is R ÷ dada2-rs
  (>1× means dada2-rs uses less memory, <1× means more).
- **Build:** `release-native` unless noted. See
  [build target](benchmarking.md#6-build-target-matters).
- **Correctness** (ASV concordance) is validated separately — see
  [concordance tooling](benchmarking.md#5-concordance-validation-tooling).

!!! note "Populate from a cluster run"
    We generate the results using `comparison/benchmark/bench_pooled.py` 
    and summarize with:
    ```bash
    python3 comparison/benchmark/bench_table.py \
        "pooled=bench_true/summary.csv" \
        "per-sample=bench_false/summary.csv" \
        "pseudo=bench_pseudo/summary.csv"
    ```
    then paste the table below.

## PacBio HiFi

* `dada2-rs v0.1.1-9a0c5da3` (v0.1.1 prerelease)
* Data is from Hergenrother 2024, 93 total samples, PacBio Sequel IIe.
* Default settings using FASTQ input for `dada` in both tools

### Overall workflow

PacBio is benchmarked from `--kmer-size 5` (matched to R's fixed
`KMER_SIZE = 5` — isolates kernel + threading speed) to `--kmer-size 7`
(dada2-rs recommended default for PacBio — adds the k-mer screen-effectiveness gain). See the [PacBio notes](benchmarking.md#7-pacbio-vs-illumina-specifics).

`*` - values from k=5 run. 

### Preliminary observation and results

**Recommendation:** use `--kmer-size 7` for PacBio runs, especially if your compute has a decent memory footprint. If you need to reduce memory and try to retain throughput, use `--kmer-size 7` and `--sample-jobs 1` for PacBio runs

#### k-mer size

- R DADA2 *currently* has a fixed (hard-coded) k-mer size of 5 for screening. This appears to have the effect of reducing k-mer screening efficiency almost to zero (a no-op), with almost every unique sequence proceeding to NW alignment. 
- Increasing the k-mer length marginally has a significant effect, dramatically reducing walltime. 
- Preliminary followup (to be added) indicates this has essentially **no impact** on the ASVs derived post-chimera removal as well as their counts, and may actually increase sensitivity slightly with a few more ASVs recovered in the `dada2-rs` runs.
- We are also evaluating the overall effect increasing k-mer sizes have on clustering with the different pooling results. Initial k=8 results confirms this increases memory usage dramatically (>100GB), so we don't anticipate this to have much practical use. 

#### ASVs

- Pre-chimera results differ slightly from R DADA2 (with some ASVs found unique to both runs). However as noted above these are essentially removed with chimera removal, suggesting their lower abundance

#### Memory vs walltime

- `dada2-rs` currently uses more memory by default (last column) under default settings, particular with higher k-mer settings. This is at the `dada-pooled`/`dada-pseudo`/`dada` stage (see below)
- `dada-pseudo` and `dada` (per-sample) memory overhead can be alleviated to run each sample serially by setting the number of concurrent jobs to one (`--sample-jobs 1`), with a small walltime penalty. 
- We're looking into potential paths to further reduce this footprint

**PacBio pseudo, k=7**  — dada2-rs vs R (R-single end-to-end wall)

| Step | dada2-rs wall (s) | dada2-rs cores | dada2-rs peak (MB) | R wall (s) | Speedup |

**PacBio, no pooling, k=7** — dada2-rs vs R (R-single end-to-end wall)

| Step | dada2-rs wall (s) | dada2-rs cores | dada2-rs peak (MB) | R wall (s) | Speedup |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| remove_primers | 19.1 | 20.8 | 29 | 5445.1 | **285.7×** |
| learn | 25.1 | 20.5 | 2717 | 159.9 | **6.4×** |
| dada | 131.9 | 21.0 | 8640 | 1542.7 | **11.7×** |

| TOTAL | 180.3 | 21.0 | 8640 | 7219.1 | **40.0×** |

Note that most of the walltime improvement is actually dominated by the `remove-primers` step (which combines two steps from DADA2: `removePrimers` and `filterAndTrim`, and parallelizes both steps; R `removePrimers` processes data serially). In many cases alternative tools like `cutadapt` can help close this gap and may prove more flexible for others. However significant improvements are also apparent for both the `learn-errors` and `dada` steps for each pooling mode.

### Streaming vs cached (`--cache-samples`)

`dada-pseudo` streams samples by default (re-reading each sample per round) rather
than holding every sample's dereplicated state resident. `--cache-samples` opts
into the older all-in-memory behavior. This characterizes that tradeoff on PacBio
(k=5, node-exclusive single rep), comparing streaming (default) as baseline
against cached. Numbers are filtered per stack with
`compare_bench.py --stack <stack>`; only the `dada` step moves materially (other
steps run on identical inputs).

| Stack | mode | dada wall (s) | dada peak | Δ wall | Δ peak |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| dada2-rs | streaming (default) | 2092.4 | 2.34 GB | — | — |
| dada2-rs | cached | 2033.5 | 8.18 GB | **−2.8%** | **+249%** |
| R-split | streaming (default) | 3737.8 | 2.86 GB | — | — |
| R-split | cached | 3454.6 | 14.86 GB | **−7.6%** | **+420%** |
| R-single | streaming (default) | 3735.1 | 3.02 GB† | — | — |
| R-single | cached | 3400.4 | 15.69 GB† | **−9.0%** | **+420%** |

`†` R-single runs the whole pipeline as one process, so peak RSS is only resolvable
process-wide (not per step); it reflects the `dada` phase, which dominates.

**Verdict:** caching buys a small walltime gain on the `dada` step at a large peak-memory
cost, and the pattern holds across all three stacks. Streaming is the right
default; `--cache-samples` stays an opt-in for the walltime-bound, memory-rich case.

Two cross-stack notes: 
- streaming-vs-streaming: `dada2-rs` is leaner and faster on `dada` (2.34 GB / 2092 s vs 2.86 GB / 3738 s)
- cached-vs-cached, dada2-rs is ~1.8× leaner (8.18 GB vs 14.86 GB) — R's resident-derep cache is not magically compact.

See [issue #22](https://github.com/HPCBio/dada2-rs/issues/22) for the keep-but-default-off
decision.

### Pre/post-update A/B (memory + speed work)

A dada2-rs-vs-itself regression check (PacBio, node-exclusive, no cache flag).

**`pre`** is `main` before recent memory/speed improvements, **`post`** is current `main`. This
spans the whole update window — a *composite* of the memory-representation change
(#23, `qual_sum:[u32]` deferred division) and the `learn-errors`/`dada` speedups (issue
#3 checklist: skip per-iteration setup, parallel `build_trans_mat`, SIMD `kmer_dist8`),
not an isolated change. **R is not a variable here, so no R numbers apply.** 

All rows are the same PacBio dataset, varying mode and k. `learn` wall falls ~−13 to −15% in every row below; the `dada` step is broken out:

| mode | k | dada wall Δ | dada CPU Δ | dada peak (pre → post) | peak Δ |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| pooled (`--pool true`) | 5 | **−14.9%** | −15.5% | 36.14 → 28.61 GB | **−20.8%** |
| pooled (`--pool true`) | 7 | **−14.4%** | −15.2% | 36.04 → 28.69 GB | **−20.4%** |
| pseudo (streaming default) | 5 | **−14.9%** | −15.1% | 6.00 → 6.30 GB | +4.9% |
| pseudo (cached, `--cache-samples`) | 7 | **−16.8%** | −17.4% | 18.27 → 13.12 GB | **−28.2%** |

**Verdict:** the **speed win is mode-independent**
— `dada` wall and CPU fall together (~−15 to −17%) at flat cores (−0.3 to −1.0%) in every mode, i.e. genuinely less work, not better parallel packing. 
- The **memory win is resident-bound**: the modes that hold all samples resident shed a large fraction of the high-water mark (pooled −20%, ~7.5 GB; cached −28%, ~5.2 GB), while the streaming pseudo path keeps only a small working set, so there is no RSS reduction to capture (a small ~300 MB uptick, single rep — read as flat, not a regression). 
- The peak ordering tracks residency exactly — pooled 36 GB > cached 18 GB > streaming 6 GB. Pooled `dada` peak is ~36 GB at both k values: at that scale the resident all-samples data dominates RSS, the 4^k screen array is washed out, and the memory delta is representation-driven, not k-related.

## Illumina MiSeq (F1000, 384 samples)

The majority of recent memory work focused on PacBio data. How does this affect Illumina data processing? 

* `dada2-rs v0.1.1-9a0c5da3` (v0.1.1 prerelease)
* Data is the F1000 'MiSeqSOP' full data set: 384 samples, MiSeq v2 run.
* Default settings using FASTQ input for `dada` in both tools

* 24 threads using release-native `dada2-rs`, `v0.1.1-a20fee47`.

*Overall workflow (filter and trim FASTQ -> removing chimeras)*

`*` - values from k=5 run

Tests prior to memory updates were from 2.4x (pooled, k=5) to 5.9x (no pooling, k=5). This round suggests a modest improvement: 3.1x to 8.5x, all at k=5. 

Prior data also suggested a small improvement for pooled samples using a higher k-mer, but in this latest run it seems to disappear, replaced with an overall improvement in performance and memory.

## Regenerating these tables

After a run, distill its `summary.csv` to Markdown:

```bash
# scorecard across modes (one row per run)
python3 comparison/benchmark/bench_table.py \
    "pooled=bench_true/summary.csv" \
    "per-sample=bench_false/summary.csv" \
    "pseudo=bench_pseudo/summary.csv"

# per-step breakdown for one run
python3 comparison/benchmark/bench_table.py --per-step bench_pseudo/summary.csv
```

Paste the output into the tables above.
