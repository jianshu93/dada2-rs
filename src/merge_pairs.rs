//! Paired-end read merging — port of DADA2's `mergePairs` from `paired.R`.
//!
//! ## Workflow
//!
//! For each sample (a matched set of forward/reverse FASTQ + dada JSON files):
//!
//! 1. The forward and reverse FASTQ files are re-dereplicated to recover the
//!    read → unique-index mapping.
//! 2. The dada JSON files supply the unique-index → ASV-index map (`map`
//!    field, always emitted by `dada` / `dada-pooled`) and the ASV sequences.
//! 3. For every read, the two maps are composed to give (fwd_asv, rev_asv).
//!    Reads where either direction is unassigned (map entry = `null`) are
//!    silently dropped.
//! 4. Distinct (fwd_asv, rev_asv) pairs are counted, then each is attempted:
//!    the forward ASV sequence is aligned (ends-free Needleman-Wunsch) against
//!    the reverse-complement of the reverse ASV sequence.  If the overlap is
//!    long enough, has few enough mismatches, and no indels, the merge is
//!    accepted and the merged amplicon sequence is assembled.
//!
//! ## Unique-index ordering guarantee
//!
//! `dereplicate()` returns uniques sorted by abundance descending (stable;
//! ties keep first-seen order) — matching R `derepFastq` ordering. The
//! chunk-parallel fold/reduce that builds the unique set runs in
//! deterministic order, so re-dereplicating the same FASTQ file yields
//! identical unique indices, regardless of thread count.  No need to save
//! a separate derep JSON: the dada JSON's `map` field references unique
//! indices that re-derepping the source FASTQ will reproduce exactly.
//!
//! **Caveat**: dada JSON files saved with the pre-sort first-seen ordering
//! cannot be merged with a post-sort dereplicate — re-derep the FASTQ
//! through the current pipeline first.
